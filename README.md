# LSTM_Web_Integration
### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model for Web Integration
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is particularly well-suited to handle sequential data4
LSTM is a type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies in data.

The interface enables users to input a sequence of numbers separated by commas and receive a prediction. For example, when the input sequence is 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, the model predicts the next value in the sequence to be approximatelyÂ 0.32117.
